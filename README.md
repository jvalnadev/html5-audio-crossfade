# HTML audio crossfade testing

Quick test to try cross-fading <audio> tags on loop. Seems to be pretty easy to
accomplish, but the <audio> tags have a bunch of issues, e.g. I couldn't get
onload events to trigger, nor could I get them to play a gapless loop.

Feel free to use this code however you wish.
